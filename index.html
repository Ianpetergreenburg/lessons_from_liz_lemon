She has had many problems thrown her way and she powers through them all with aplomb, a little bit of scotch tape and the power of Lizbeanism. By following her example you will be able to tackle any and all issues in life head-on. You can find a unabridged version of her teachings <a href="http://www.30rockquotes.net/">here.</a></p>
<!-- The linked website is my example website I am looking to for comparison. Without looking at the code it is a very basic website, but most of it's flaws come from the color scheme rather than poor user design. Of the code itself, a lot of it is understandable to me, which I'm interpreting as meaning this is a very basically designed website. The semantics for sectioning of the website seems poor but they do manage to create a cooler website than I could manage so they must be doing something right.-->
